## How to contribute to this project

There are many ways to help a project: **logging a bug**, **submitting a PR request**, **reporting a problem**, and **making a great suggestion**. **Even if you have **push permissions** on the repository, you should create a **personal fork** when needed and create a feature branch there. This keeps the main repository **clean** and your personal workflow unaffected. We are also interested in your feedback on the future of this project. You can submit suggestions or feature requests through the **issue** **tracker**. To make this process more efficient, we ask that these include more information to help define them more clearly.
